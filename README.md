# Age Trends Among Olympic Athletes

## Dataset


The data consists of information regarding 130,000 Olympic athletes and the
events they participated in for Olympic games from 1896 to 2016, including Sex,
Age, Country, Sport, Medal, and more. The dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results/downloads/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results.zip/2),
with feature documentation available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results/home).


## Summary of Findings

In the exploration, I looked for trends in the mean age of the athletes over
time, and I selected findings that seemed relevant to that in some way, even
if indirectly. I found that the mean age of Olympic athletes mostly has a
downward trend for the first ~80 years, and then, contrary to my expectations,
has an upward trend until 2016. Those later mean age increases have been more
dramatic for females than for males (closing much of the earlier age gap with
men), and even more so especially for female non-medalists.

The mean age trends vary widely among the various sports, with Athletics having
a fairly linear upward trend throughout the entire timespan, and Figure Skating
having a very steep U shape. Gymnastics maintains a very wide age margin between
the sexes, whereas Speed Skating has closed the age gap in recent times.
Nevertheless, it is common among the sports for there to be an age increase in
modern times.

The percent of athletes who have participated in a previous Olympiad has
increased dramatically over time, to about 37% in recent games. The number of
athletes that have participated in n Olympiads has a strongly logarithmic
relationship to n: about 30% of each group of athletes has gone on to compete
again later.

One factor that explains some of the age increase is longer careers. However,
the mean age of new Olympic athletes has also been increasing.

Since around 1960, medalists have generally been older than non-medalists.

Outside of the main interests, I found that the female-to-male ratio of
athletes started very low, with no official female athletes in the first
Olympiad in 1896, but has risen quite steadily to about 43% in recent games.
Athletics has by far the most athletes, attracting about one-fifth of the Summer
Olympic athletes over time. Ice Hockey has similarly attracted about one-fifth
of the Winter Olympic athletes.


## Key Insights for Presentation

The mean age of Olympic athletes mostly has a downward trend for ~80 years, and
then has an upward trend until 2016. Those later mean age increases have been
more dramatic for females than for males (closing much of the earlier age gap
with men), and even more so especially for female non-medalists.

There is a strong general trend toward a higher percentage of returning
athletes over time, for both sexes. This trend contributes to some but not all
of the mean age increase.

Since around 1960, medalists have generally been older than non-medalists.

The mean age trends vary widely among the various sports, but most have at
least some slight increase in mean age in modern times for both sexes.
