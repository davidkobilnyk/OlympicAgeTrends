# Age Trends Among Olympic Athletes

## Dataset


The data consists of information regarding 130,000 Olympic athletes and the
events they participated in for Olympic games from 1896 to 2016, including Sex,
Age, Country, Sport, Medal, and more. The dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results/downloads/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results.zip/2),
with feature documentation available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results/home).


## Summary of Findings

In the exploration, I found that the mean age of Olympic athletes mostly has a
downward trend for the first ~80 years, and then, contrary to my expections,
has an upward trend until 2016. The mean age of females has more dramatic
upward movements (closing much of the earlier age gap with men), especially
female non-medalists, females on their last games season, and females in the
Summer games.

The mean age trends vary widely among the various sports, with Athletics having
a fairly linear upward trend throughout the entire timespan, and Figure Skating
having a very steep U shape. Gymnastics maintains a very wide age margin between
the sexes, whereas Speed Skating has closed the age gap in recent times.

The percent of athletes who have participated in a previous Olympiad has
increased dramatically over time, to about 37% in recent games. The number of
athletes that have participated in n Olympiads has a strongly logarithmic
relationship to n: about 30% of each group of athletes has gone on to compete
again later.

The female-to-male ratio of athletes started very low, with no official female
athletes in the first Olympiad in 1896, but has risen quite steadily to about
43% in recent games.

Outside of the main interests, I found that the female-to-male ratio of
athletes started very low, with no official female athletes in the first
Olympiad in 1896, but has risen quite steadily to about 43% in recent games.
Athletics has by far the most athletes, attracting about one-fifth of the Summer
Olympic athletes over time. Ice Hockey has similarly attracted about one-fifth
of the Winter Olympic athletes.
